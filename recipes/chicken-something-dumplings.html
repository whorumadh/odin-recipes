From the famed Hungry Halfling in Faerûn's Corm Orp to nearly every halfling suppertime table across the land, this hearty, velvety concoction laden with homemade drop dumplings is the coziest of comfort foods. There are countless variants of this dish, with each halfling household claiming to serve the finest, but nothing beats the thick-and-stewy classic—a robust poultry stock base, emboldened with the tastes of freshly picked veggies, parsley, and garlic all comingled with creamy dough.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 leeks, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup dry sherry, such as Amontillado</li>
        <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and diagonally cut into 1-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, trimmed and diagonally cut into 1-inch slices</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dumplings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 scallions, green and white parts, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or reserved chicken fat (from browning the chicken)</li>
        <li>¾ cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>To make the stew</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>sprinkle the chicken thighs all over with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Arrange half the chicken skin-side down in the Dutch oven, adjust the heat to medium, and cook, undisturbed, until the skin is browned, about 5 minutes. Turn over the chicken and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is browned, about 5 minutes more; adjust the heat if it starts to scorch. Transfer the chicken to a large plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken thighs (and reserve any accumulated chicken fat). When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice one of the leek halves. Cut the remaining three leek halves into 1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the pot, return it to medium heat, and melt and swirl in the pot to coat. Add the thinly sliced leeks, bay leaves, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the leeks are softened, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and flour and continue to cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes more. Add the sherry and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the pan bottom to loosen and dissolve any browned bits. Continue to simmer, stirring, until the liquid is thickened and slightly reduced, about 1 minute more. Gradually add the broth, stirring vigorously to incorporate it smoothly.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken thighs with any of the accumulated juices to the pot and return to a simmer. Adjust the heat to very low, cover, and simmer gently until the chicken is cooked through and very tender, about 1 hour, turning the chicken pieces over after about 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and shred it into large chunks. Remove the bay leaves from the pot, add the shredded chicken, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper; stir to mix. Over medium-high heat, return to a simmer. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To make the dumplings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, onion powder, salt, and a few grinds of pepper in a bowl. Add the scallions and toss to combine. In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the butter and olive oil (or reserved chicken fat, if you have any), stopping to swirl occasionally, to melt the butter. Add the milk and continue to microwave on high until the mixture is just warm (do not overheat), about 1½ minutes. Add the warmed milk mixture to the flour mixture. With a wooden spoon or fork, mix until incorporated and uniformly moist (the mixture should look like a wet, shaggy dough).</li>
        <li>To finish the chicken and cook the dumplings, add the carrots, celery, 1-inch leek pieces, and most of the parsley to the stew and stir to incorporate it. Using a soup spoon, drop twelve golf ball–size portions of dumpling dough into the pot, placing them about ½ inch apart (drop eight around the perimeter and four in the center). Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook undisturbed until the dumplings are puffed and cooked through, and a toothpick inserted into them comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle the stew into bowls, allowing three dumplings per portion. Sprinkle each with some of the remaining parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
