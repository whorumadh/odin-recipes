    <h1>Community Cheeses</h1>
    <img src="https://5e.tools/img/recipes/HF/090_Newm_9781984858900_lay_art_r1.webp" width="20%" alt="Cheesy fondue with bread cubes and a fondue fork.">
    <p>It wouldn't be a halfling jamboree without a cauldron of community cheeses on the table for all to enjoy! This multi-cheese concoction is composed of two types, slowly melted with a spritz of wine in a fondue pot over an even, low heat. The key is to not overcook nor let the unique cheese flavors homogenize, which ensures that each bite is streaked with a surprising new taste combination. Usually presented with fruits, meat chunks, or cubed breads, this fondue is perfect for dagger-dipping. Just be sure to clean the blood off first!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dippers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Broccoli and/or cauliflower, trimmed and cut into bite-size florets</li>
        <li>Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved</li>
        <li>Roasted or steamed potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>Apples and/or pears, peeled, if desired, cored, and cut into bite-size pieces (toss with a small amount of fresh lemon juice to slow browning)</li>
        <li>Ham steak, sautéed until lightly browned, and cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>Baguette or other good French bread, cut into bite-size pieces (each with some crust)</li>
        <li>Raisin bread or dried fruit-nut bread or rolls, lightly toasted and cut into bite-size pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fondue</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces Gruyère cheese, coarsely grated (4 cups, lightly packed), at room temperature</li>
        <li>12 ounces Emmental cheese, coarsely grated (4 cups, lightly packed), at room temperature</li>
        <li>1⅔ cups crisp, dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Kirsch or Poire Williams</li>
        <li>Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg (optional)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black or white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the dippers</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blanch the broccoli or cauliflower in boiling salted water until just tender, about 4 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Then drain until dry or blot dry.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the fondue</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the Gruyère and Emmental cheeses and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk ⅓ cup of the wine and the cornstarch to blend, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine the remaining 1⅓ cups of wine and two of the garlic cloves and bring to a simmer. Remove the garlic, whisk the cornstarch mixture to recombine, add it to the pan, and stir constantly, until thickened, 15 to 30 seconds. Stir in the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Adjust the heat to medium-low and add about ½ cup of the cheese, stirring constantly but gently until fully melted. Repeat with the remaining cheeses in ½-cup increments, each time stirring until melted fully before adding more, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring constantly but gently, until the mixture is smooth and just begins to bubble, about 4 minutes more. Do not allow the mixture to boil; adjust the heat, if necessary. Add the Kirsch, nutmeg (if using), ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm a fondue pot with hot water, empty it, and dry it well. Rub the inside of the pot with the remaining garlic clove and pour in the fondue. Set the pot over a heat source, and serve at once with the dippers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
    <p><em>There is a lot of variation in the way cheeses melt. To increase your odds of a smooth outcome, use grated cheese at room temperature. Many experts advise using cheeses that are younger than a year old and avoiding those sourced from supermarket deli counters.</em></p>
    <p><em>Cheeses can differ in saltiness, so season the fondue carefully. Start with ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and taste. If necessary, add more salt by the ¼ teaspoon.</em></p>
